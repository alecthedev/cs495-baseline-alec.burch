# About me - Alec Burch-DeWitt 

## Programming languages
 - I am most familiar with Python and Java
 - I have used Bash, C, MySQL, JavaScript, Lua, and Dart academically or for small projects
## Experience
I have mostly written code for personal projects and courses. 

**Projects - oldest to most recent**
- [CLI version of the card game 'Caravan' from Fallout: New Vegas](https://github.com/alecthedev/project4-caravan)
- ['Boid' (bird-like object) simulation](https://github.com/alecthedev/tk-boids)
- [Hexagonal version of Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/alecthedev/hex-life)
- [Loot Generator tool for Dungeons and Dragons campaigns](https://github.com/alecthedev/dnd-loot-generator)

I have many smaller projects public on my Github page as well.
## Largest program/system worked on
My [Loot Generator tool for DnD campaigns](https://github.com/alecthedev/dnd-loot-generator) is probably the most extensive program I wrote code for. It was a group project with 3 other individuals, and was built for our advanced programming course. 
## What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
I am comfortable doing most things that pertain to backend logic. 

I have built programs that use databases, rely on heavy string processing ([markdown to HTML - static site generator](https://github.com/alecthedev/static-site-generator)), require learning new math (vector transformations - Boid project), and use external APIs (DnD loot generator). I have also made a few games.

If I do not understand something when programming, then I will try to learn it. For example, I use Arch as my main OS. This has helped me learn a great deal about how my system operates just by handling any issues as they come up.

For me, the more challenging the better - because that is when I learn the most. 
## What do you feel least comfortable doing?
I am least experienced when it comes to building a GUI or making web/mobile applications, so that is naturally where I am least comfortable working. 

I am typically fine if my personal program lacks a complicated GUI - as one can probably tell from most of my listed projects - so long as the underlying logic is something that I am proud of.
